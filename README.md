# BioSeq Python Class

This Python script defines a `BioSeq` class for working with DNA sequences. The class provides methods for sequence validation, random sequence generation, nucleotide frequency calculation, transcription, DNA complement, reverse complement, GC content calculation, translation, generating reading frames, and identifying open reading frames (ORFs) that may encode proteins.

## Usage

### 1. Initialization
You can create a `BioSeq` object by providing a DNA sequence, sequence type (default is DNA), and an optional label. If the provided sequence is not a valid DNA sequence, an assertion error will be raised.

```python
my_sequence = BioSeq(seq="ATCGGCTA", seq_type="DNA", label="Example DNA")
